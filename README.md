# Prettier Ruby Plugin

Check back soon :)

### Update

It now supports updating function definations.

## This is still very experimental.

All it does right now is to extract some AST nodes into JSON for prettier to process and print an updated version via a generic Printer (Only Word limits are working as of now).
